# SLURM Scheduling
Simple Linux Utility for Resource Management (SLURM) is a software package for submitting, scheduling, and monitoring jobs on large compute clusters.  Advance Computing Center for Research and Education (ACCRE)-Vanderbilt had data questions related with submitting and monitoring jobs on ACCREâ€™s Vampire cluster. 
### This was a team-based learning project performed during Data Science Bootcamp at Nashville Software School (NSS).

### Data Questions
1) As you request more RAM, how does that impact your queue time?

2) As you request more wall time, how does that impact your queue time?

3) Are there nodes that fail more often than others? ** ignore cases where multiple nodes are used

4) Are there users who are clogging up the flow by running too many small jobs? Greater than 500 jobs, each less than 5 minutes, within 4 hours
